### 🧠 About Me
I work at the intersection of task-specific imaging hardware and computational reconstruction algorithms.  
My co-design work includes:
- Super-resolution/sub-Nyquist/event-driven ultrasound imaging
- Near-field event-driven radar imaging
- Event-driven single-exposure high-dynamic range imaging
